# CustomVeloSlideshow
Custom Element created using Velo API, includes equavalent HTML


## Slideshow.js

This file is a slideshow created using [Velo API](https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/api-overview/introduction) to create custom Wix element. The included wix slideshow did not function properly so I created a custom element that functions similarly.

The slideshow is 100vw with a ratio of about 2.69/1. The slideshow is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile.

## index.html

This file shows the same slideshow written in HTML. I drafted the slideshow in HTML before attempting the Velo API. A clear difference can be seen between the size and complexity of the two files.
